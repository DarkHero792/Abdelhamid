## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate and motivated web developer with a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Currently enrolled in the **ALX Pro-Development program**, I'm constantly sharpening my skills and building projects that solve real-world problems.

My journey into software engineering began with a deep curiosity about how websites work and a strong desire to bring ideas to life through code. I’m inspired by the impact technology can have on improving lives, and I strive to be part of that positive change.

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- React.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Next.js  
- Git & GitHub Best Practices  

🎯 My Vision:  
To become a **master in front-end web development** and secure a **financially stable, fulfilling tech role** where I contribute meaningfully to innovative products.

💡 I love working on:  
- Responsive websites  
- Front-end UI/UX projects  
- Real-world apps that improve everyday tasks
